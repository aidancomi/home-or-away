# Connected to Home Network? (Home or Away via DDNS)
This is some simple PHP that allows me to test if I am connected to my home network.

## Explanation
I wanted to use PHP to check my IP against my home IP, this is useful when VPN tunneling to my house or VPN tunneling out of my house. This requires a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) setup, I use the DDNS built in to my ASUS router, in this case with a custom domain.

## Set Up

To setup this repository for yourself, replace `DDNS-Domain.example` with your DDNS domain (ex. aidan.asuscomm.com), then host to your VPS of your choice.

## Notes
This is my very first PHP project, so it's not perfect! Please let me know if you have any other reccomendations for improvements!
