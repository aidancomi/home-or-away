# Connected to Home Network? (Home or Away via DDNS)
## This is some simple PHP that allows me to test if I am connected to my home network.
This was some simple PHP I wanted to use to check my IP against my home IP, this is useful when VPN tunneling to my house or VPN tunneling out of my house. This requires a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) setup, I use the DDNS built in to my ASUS router, in this case with a custom domain.

## Set Up

To setup this repository for yourself, replace the 'DDNS-Domain.example' with your DDNS domain (ex. aidan.asuscomm.com), then host to your VPS of your choice.
